RepeatModeler 1.0.9
===================

   - RepeatModeler employs a genome sampling approach that is based
     on a random number generator. In this release of RepeatModeler
     we print out the random number generator seed at the start of 
     a run.  This number can be used with the "-srand ####" in future
     runs to exactly reproduce the samples taken from a given database.
    
   - Support for Dfam_consensus has been built into this release. Two
     utilities dfamConsensusTool.pl and renameIds.pl can be found in the
     RepeatModeler util/ directory.  The dfamConsensusTool script enables
     one to upload curated seed alignments to the open Dfam_consensus 
     database from the command line.  The renameIds script simplifies
     the process of coming up with unique identifiers for a set of 
     RepeatModeler generated families given a naming template.
